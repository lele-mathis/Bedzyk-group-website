Interfacial science by its very nature brings together a diverse interests in oxide films, catalysis,semiconductors, nano-science, bio-membranes, surface physics, corrosion, and electrochemistry. One of many grand challenges in the overall interdisciplinary field of interfacial science is the need to observe and control the assembly of atoms, molecules and supported nanoparticles at well-defined interfaces in complex environments. With atomic resolution and high penetrating power, we are developing and applying sophisticated in situ X-ray methods to meet these challenges."

        Our research program includes the development of novel
        X-ray probes and the characterization of surface, interface,
        and thin-film structures with atomic resolution. We conduct
        our experiments using both in-house and synchrotron X-ray
        facilities. The latter have greatly enhanced chemical and
        structural sensitivity for studying systems as dilute as
        one-hundredth of an atomic monolayer.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to using more conventional X-ray scattering and
        spectroscopy techniques, we have developed a number of methods for
        generating X-ray standing waves with differing characteristic length
        scales. We use these periodic X-ray probes to pinpoint the lattice
        location of adsorbate atoms on crystalline surfaces, to measure
        strain within epitaxially grown semiconductor and ferroelectric thin
        films, and to locate heavy atoms within ordered ultrathin organic
        films.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using a state-of-the-art surface science facility at the
        <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov">Advanced Photon Source</a>, we
        perform in situ analysis of surface structures and phase
        transformations of MBE-grown ordered atomic monolayers on
        semiconductor and complex oxide surfaces. We also use X-ray standing
        waves, high-resolution X-ray diffraction, and X-ray absorption
        spectroscopy for structural characterization of buried
        strained-layer semiconductor heterostructures, ferroelectric thin
        films and the water/crystalline interface.

          interface play a significant role for the functional aspects of the 2D system. Knowledge of such a buried

          Peptide amphiphiles (PA) can assemble in a variety of morphologies.
          To understand how electrostatics drives the transformation in
          morphology and molecular packing, we studied the assembly of a
          charge-tunable (via pH) ionic PA by a combination of solution small
          and wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS), cryo-transmission
          electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) and Monte-Carlo simulations.

          remain surprisingly mysterious, despite the critical roles that
          catalysts play in a variety of industrial and environmental
